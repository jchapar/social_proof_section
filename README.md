## My process

I started this project with a mobile first approach. I knew I would be using grid for the desktop version so I made sure to keep each section in their own containers. I used SASS partials to keep the styling of each component separate. This helped keep my styling more organized and easier to follow along.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I had to take a step back and review CSS Grid. Grid helped me set and place the different section in place for the desktop version.
In regards to SASS, I've really been enjoying using partial files for styling different sections and components of the challenge. It's been helping my keep things organized and clean.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zBsdzdE4sM&t=793s) - I watched this video by Web Dev Simplified to review and practice working with grid. It's a great resource for any new or experienced developer when a CSS Grid review is needed.
